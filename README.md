# C-_CustomerList
Using C# create a custom list class w/o using any of the built-in list or array methods

Requirements:
(20 points) As a developer, I want to use Test Driven Development (TDD), so that I can write tests for my methods to pass to ensure proper functionality within my application. There needs to be several tests per method.
(5 points): As a developer, I want to make good, consistent commits.
(10 points): As a developer, I want to use a custom-built list class that stores its values in an array, so that I can store any data type in my collection.
(10 points): As a developer, I want the ability to add an object to an instance of my custom-built list class.
(10 points): As a developer, I want the ability to remove an object from an instance of my custom-built list class.
(10 points): As a developer, I want the custom list class to be iterable.
(10 points): As a developer, I want to be able to override the ToString method that converts the contents of the custom list to a string.
(10 points): As a developer, I want to be able to overload the + operator, so that I can add two instances of the custom list class together.
(10 points): As a developer, I want to be able to overload the – operator, so that I can subtract one instance of a custom list class from another instance of a custom list class.
(10 points): As a developer, I want a Count property implemented on the custom-built list class, so that I can get a count of the number of elements in my custom list class instance.
(10 points): As a developer, I want the ability to zip two custom list class instances together in the form of a zipper. An example:
-	I have List<int> odd = new List<int>() {1,3,5}; and List<int> even = new List<int>() {2,4,6}; 
-	When lists odd and even are zipped together, your new list will contain values 1,2,3,4,5,6
(10 points): As a developer, I want to use C# best practices, SOLID design principles, and good naming conventions on the project. 
(Bonus 5 points): As a developer, I want the ability to sort an instance of my custom-built list class. To be eligible for the bonus points, you may not use Array.Sort() that is already built in and you must tell us what sorting algorithm you used.
(Bonus 5 points): As a developer, I want the ability to earn bonus points for an EASTER EGG user story, regarding implementing a specific good practice on one of the methods specified in a user story above.
